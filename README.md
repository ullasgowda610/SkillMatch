# SKILLMATCH
This project is an AI-powered application designed to analyze and tailor resumes according to specific job requirements.
It uses Streamlit, Google Generative AI, and custom functions to process resumes and compare them against job descriptions.
With the help of prompt engineering, the model is instructed to interpret resume content, evaluate relevance, and highlight matches with the given role.

The solution is deployed using Streamlit, providing a simple and interactive interface for users to upload resumes and receive insights instantly.
